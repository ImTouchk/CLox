# CLox
CLox is a compiler & bytecode VM for the toy language Lox. It is written in pure C, with no external libraries.

# Code Style
I tried focusing on readability and consistency in the code base.

Naming conventions:
* Functions and variables: snake_case
* Structure names: PascalCase
* Enumerators: SCREAMING_CASE

Abbreviation either happen everywhere (see: `table.h` | ex: table_set / table_del / etc) or do not happen at all.

# Building
I'm using Visual Studio on Windows, but the project should be easy to set up on any platform.
